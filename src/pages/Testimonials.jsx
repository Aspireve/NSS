        "JAI HIND !My journey as an NSS volunteer has been nothing short of transformative. Stepping into the world of community service through NSS has broadened my perspective and instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility towards the society we live in.One of the most profound experiences during my time as an NSS volunteer was when our Unit organized a toys and book distribution camp in a rural village. Witnessing the gratitude and hope in the eyes of the villagers and childrens as they received the toys, clothes and stuff made me realize the impact small acts of service can have on the lives of others.Through various initiatives like tree plantation drives, awareness campaigns, and cleanliness programs, I not only contributed to the betterment of the environment and the community but also developed a strong bond with my fellow volunteers. Furthermore, coordinating with local authorities, managing resources efficiently, and mobilizing volunteers to work harmoniously taught me valuable lessons in effective teamwork and communication. Beyond the tangible benefits, being an NSS volunteer has nurtured a sense of empathy and compassion within me, fostering a deep understanding of the diverse challenges faced by different sections of society.It has inspired me to continue serving my community even after my NSS tenure, making a commitment to contribute to the betterment of society in any way I can.NSS has not just been a part of my college life;it has become an integral part of my identity, shaping my values and aspirations. It has taught me that the true essence of life lies in the service of others, and I am forever grateful for the enriching experiences and lifelong lessons it has offered me.JAI HIND !",

        "JAI HIND ! As a less social person, I often found myself feeling like an outsider among my peers. I tended to gravitate towards solitary activities, preferring to spend my time alone watching movies, learning something new, or simply sitting quietly with my thoughts. Social situations made me uncomfortable, and I often felt like I didn't belong. That's when I decided to step out of my comfort zone and join NSS.Without a question, the best aspect of my experience was the recruitment procedure. I was able get exposure while engaging in a variety of activities by joining NSS, in addition to giving me a chance to give back to society. During the projects, I found myself engaging in teamwork and collaboration, something I had always shied away from. Working with fellow volunteers on community projects became a catalyst for personal growth. I discovered the joy of contributing to something larger than myself. The experience of organizing and Participating in a range of activities, including cleanliness drives, visits to old age homes, blood donations, and The Sojourn Dance, within the NSS has afforded me diverse settings and opportunities. These experiences have contributed to the development of my ability to effectively balance my commitment to serving others with the pursuit of personal fulfillment and enjoyment. One of the most surprising aspects was the support and camaraderie I found among my fellow volunteers. The shared goal of making a positive impact brought us together, and I realized that I wasn't alone in my journey.Being part of NSS has been one of the most significant experiences in my life. I believe everyone should consider dedicating a small portion of their lives to helping others. In doing so, you lose nothing but gain a unique and fulfilling kind of happiness. JAI HIND ! ",

It was more than the projects we undertook; it was about building family and bonds that I will cherish forever in my life. From being confused about whether to join NSS or not, To being emotional as we are coming towards the end of our tenure, this journey turned out to be the best part of my college life. I was part of the last phase of the recruitment. It was like maine yeh NSS ki bus ekdam aakhri boarding point pe pakdi hai, and I am thankful ki meri yeh bus chuti nahi or else zindagi ka ek khubsurat hissa miss ho jata. The happiness and satisfaction of doing social work are incomparable. The NSS unit has become my second family now. The best part of my tenure was the camp that I attended. Those seven days were the cherry on top. From waking up at 5 a.m. and working in groups for the betterment of the village to enjoying bonding sessions together, each and every moment is etched in my heart. SE and TE mai alag level bonding hua. ‚ÄúTeam Infinity‚Äù was legit the best team (because I was part of it üòÇ). Aur ha Jhaakas Jhaadu Supremacy hamesha rahegiüòÇ. The most emotional part of the camp was the last day, where everyone was busy writing the memories made with each other on the pages which we got and suddenly the song ‚ÄúYaaron Dosti Badi hi Haseen Hai‚Äù played. Believe me, sab log almost rone wale the. Really bohot bura lag raha tha ki yeh 7 din itne jaldi kyun beet gaye. But Sach mai these lines Raatein Beet Jaati hai, Yaadein Yaad Aati Hai‚Äù made sense that day.Also, I feel lucky, as I got one more chance to go to the campsite, and this time it was for a 1-day project. Visiting the campsite again really made me nostalgic, as all the camp memories were refreshed. And usi mai, we formed the 11th group. ‚ÄúTeam Millets‚Äù ke saath bhi bohot maje kiye, whether it might be the practice sessions or jaate and aate waqt bus ke maje. Yeh sabhi moments dil mai ghar banake baithe hai. But abhi sach mai bohot emotional feel ho Raha hai, as yeh sab kuch ab kuch dino Mai khatam ho jayega. But still, I won't cry because it's over, but I'm happy because it happened. ‚ÄúIss Poore Safar Mai Kuch Dost Khaas Mil Gaye, Mile Toh Mulaqat Bichde Toh Yaad Ban Gaye‚Äù. Sach mai maine iss 2 saal mai dost nahi kamaye, but ek parivaar kamaya hai, and I know this will last forever.Overall, the whole experience was Laii Bhariiiiü´∂ Once a Volunteer, Always A Volunteer ‚ù£Ô∏è JAI HIND !",

        "JAI HIND ! One of my fondest memories of being a part of NSS would always be the 7 Day Residential Camp in Saiwan. Participating in the NSS Camp in Saiwan village was a transformative experience that left an indelible mark on my heart. Over the course of seven days, I had the privilege of immersing myself in the vibrant culture and close-knit community of Saiwan. The camp not only provided an opportunity for community service but also fostered personal growth and lifelong connections.Engaging in various service activities, from organizing health camps to conducting educational workshops, allowed me to witness the positive impact we could make as a united team. The enthusiasm and gratitude of the villagers were truly heartening, reinforcing the significance of our collective efforts.Living amidst the simplicity of Saiwan, I discovered the beauty of communal living and the importance of sustainable practices. The evenings filled with activities meant to create and foster a stronger bond amongst us Volunteers, is something that I miss.Beyond the tangible contributions, the camp instilled in me a sense of responsibility and empathy. It was a journey of self-discovery, teaching me resilience, adaptability, and the joy that accompanies selfless service. The friendships forged during those seven days are lasting, transcending geographical boundaries.In retrospect, the NSS Camp in Saiwan was not just a service initiative; it was a holistic experience that shaped my values and perspective. It reinforced the belief that positive change begins at the grassroots level, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this impactful endeavour with the Volunteers who I can now proudly call my Family!

My best experiences were the MU projects and the projects where we are interacting with people around. Making posters and flexing our talents in one or the other way. But every NSS volunteer who has been to NSS camp will agree with me that it's the best thing that has ever happened to us. ‚ÄúNSS mein hokar agar Camp nahi gaye toh kya kiya?‚Äù is real. Camp is an emotion for all of us as we not as SE and TE but as Group-10, as family. Aur woh Aaji mujhe humesha yaad rahegi aur bacche mujhe humesha yaad rahenge. Woh saat din mujhe humesha yaad rahenge. Humare strict and pyaare councils humesha yaad rahenge. Unhone humein bohot kuch sikhaya, jaise discipline mein rehkar maze kaise karte hai aur khud se pehle dusro ki madat karna. Woh din humesha yaad rahenge, NSS humesha yaad rahega.

        "JAI HIND ! This would probably be the last feedback that would not be enough. Joining NSS has been one of the best decisions I have made in college. I still wonder how these two years passed so quickly. I still remember our recruitment phase, and at that time I was like, ‚Äúkaha aake fass gaye‚Äù, but now I can say it was definitely worth it. The way NSS rules were taught to us until the last project has been a great journey throughout. I'm overwhelmed by the great experiences, lessons, and relationships I've developed. Being part of the Creative Team was a highlight for me, and yes, it was Indeed the Best. We were scolded many times yeh aisa kyu hai professionalism kaha hai, but at the same time we got an opportunity to learn new things and to improve ourselves. NSS is not just about strictness in the end; it‚Äôs all about fun and beautiful memories. NSS has taught me punctuality, discipline, and overall personal development. I never imagined that I would begin working with folks who, at first, seemed like any other volunteer to me but have now become family. The best thing was NSS Camp; those 7 days were full of amazing experiences and unforgettable memories. This is one of the things that will always be cherished. The amount of joy and connections built throughout is amazing. Congratulations to the present council as well; they did an excellent job. The moments we made together will always have a special place in my heart. I will miss my NSS Family, and as they say ‚ÄúONCE A VOLUNTEER ALWAYS A VOLUNTEER‚Äù. JAI HIND !",

Besides teaching how to be disciplined, respectful and punctual, NSS has taught how to live a joyful life. It has introduced so many new faces which selflessly loved one another and cared for everyone. The journey from the beginning till the end has given me endless memories. As I look back, I only see smiles on the faces of my fellow colleagues and the society which we worked for. All the hard work and fun which we did during the projects will be missed. The bond between the SE and TE has been amazing and will be forever. Learning from each other, taking each other's care and enjoying all the moments. All the projects taught me new things, new memories. The dance during the Ganapati Visarjan project, the Zephyr Inauguration Dance, the Republic Day Parade Practices, the Beach Clean-up, the Sojourn Dance and such beautiful memories will never be forgotten. The Camp has made a special place in my life. The locals and the children there have made me realise many things. Waha ke bacho ke chehro ki smiles dekh kr bohot aacha laga. Those sleepless nights, the activities, the bonding sessions and all the fun will never be forgotten. Jab skit practice kar rhe the tab school ke baache jis tarah bagha ke aaye aur school ki windows par khade hogaye, wo meri sabse favourite memory hai. The laughs, cheers and joy on their faces were mesmerizing. The smiles on the faces of the villagers when we distributed clothes, foods and stationery.

        "JAI HIND ! Wo haseen lamhe‚Ä¶.From the 17th of September 2022, I do never thought would be making the best of memories of my college life! Discipline, punctuality and respect ‚Äì such core values were etched within me forever. Dheere Dheere naye dost bane, projects mai maza aane laga aur mere andar ka introvertness bhi chala gaya. I started being grateful and took pride of being an NSS volunteer. Na jaane kitne posters banae inn dino mai, na jane kitne surveys liye, na jane kitne paper bags banae, na jane kitne debate kiye, na jane kitne anginat yaadein banae aur na jane kitne lamhon ko khushi se jiya. NSS activities ne mujhe vo sab sikha diya jo mai shayad hi kabhi sikh pata. Dekhte hi dekhte humara NSS Unit ka ek bada parivaar hi ban gaya. Camp aur Sojourn ki vo mauj masti ko mai kaise bhulunga! NSS residential camp mai vo 7-8 din ka experience kisi IV se kam nahi (koi comparison hi nahi banta actually). Best days, best memories with lovely people. Sojourn 2023 ka dance video will be saved with me for long.MU projects attend karne mai bhi kafi maza aata tha (college bunk karne jo milta tha lol). Aur bhi boht sare yaadgaar pal hai but what happens in NSS, stays in NSS! You cannot miss this once in a lifetime experience. Kuch rahe ya na rahe, ye do saal ka NSS volunteering journey mujhe humesha yaad rahega. Once a NSS volunteer, always a NSS volunteer! JAI HIND ! ",

Matlab bhai jo expect nhi kiya tha wo sab experience karne mila . I think ye NSS ki khasiyat hi hai ki ye bohot hi unexpected haiüòâ. Matalab ham soch te kuch aur hai par uska outcome kuch aur hi hota hai. Jaise NSS ka koi bhi project boring nhi lagega aapkoüòå. bhalehi aapko bas ek poster banana ho ya koi survey lenaho. Sare project mai mazza aata hi hai and mereliye tho jaise naye project aata gaye waise naye dost bannae hmari dosti gehri hoti gai and projects ka mazza bhi maaz tho aana hi tha. Do sal sabkeliye kuch na kuch unexpected laya haiand ham aur hmare councils hamesha yehi try karte rehenge ki aur kaise sabko kuch unexpected late rahe. Hmare do salomaise pehla saal tho pura online nikla . Lekin fir bhi naye dost banana mai ye sirf online mile rukawat nhi bani. Online hokar bhi sirf ek screen se bate karke bhi naye dost bansakte hai ye hamne pehle saal mai sikhliya tha. Jaise mujhe aaj bhi yaad hai ki ek yoga ka project tha hmare. Hame kya laga bas ek siminar hoga and bas on kareke baith janan hai. Fir pata chala ki hame bhi yoga karna hai. Ye hamne nhi socha tha. Lekin maza aaya mera ek dost tho yoga karte karte apne hi bed se girgay tha ye dekhkar ham itna hase itna hase ki mujhe tho merea camera bandh karna pada kyu ki haste haste mai khud na mere bed se gir jata. NSS ka council banana ki jab mujhe opportunity mili tho maine wo leli without any second thoughts issmai mere council ka mai dilse shukriya karta hu ki mujhe unhone ye opportunity di and mujhe islayak samjha ki mai ye karpau. Council banne ka experience mereliye both hi eye opening tha. I mean I got to know what actually happens bts . And turst mi ye bohot hi jyada mehnat ka kaam hai. Matlat agar NSS aap sirf ek volunteer ki najro se dekho tho aakp sare projects mai aana hai kaam karna hai waha and ghar chalejana hai which is a challenge in itself no doubt, but begin an council wo project volunteers keliye lana was a like a mission impossible kinda scenario in itself. From permission from clg to the permission from the police official or the MLA or any big person the process is very tiring. Ye mujhe nhi pata tha ki NSS ka bas ek simple sa project jo clg mai karna hai uskee piche bhi itna sara kaam and efforts lagte hai . But as I said NSS is the treasure of experience and unexpectedness. Abhi jyada bol kae mai kisiko emotional nhi karna chahta ya khoud hona chahta huüòé (chasme ke andar aansu Chup aarha hu). Lekin bas itna kahunga ki NSS ne mujhe bohot sari chize di hai and I will be always in debt of it. As we always say Once a volunteer always a volunteer. JAI HIND !!!!!",

        "Jai Hind! Allow me tell y‚Äôall about a roller coaster that I had sat on without thinking twice, the jump I had made blindly and head first. NSS was always a part of the plan, uss plan ka step 1 tha Recruitment. For a shy SE kid, it was a challenge of a lifetime. Anokhe kisse sunne the jis safar ke baare me, woh mehsoos bhi kar liya. But today if I am asked to speak of it, it is definitely a memory I cherish with utmost gratitude. Haste-khelte, ghirte-sambhalte, naye dost banaate-banaate nikal gaya online humara pehla saal. Par picture abhi baaki thi mere dost! TE ke shuruwaat me, interval ke baad, shuru hui ek daud: Council bann ne ki daud. Iraada: haan, plan: nada. Par Geet ne kaha tha ‚Äúaisa lagg raha tha kuch galat ho raha ho, jaise koi train chhot rahi ho‚Äù and I felt that. I was literally the last person to append my name on the list made for interview rounds. Khoon, paseena, upar waale ka saath aur sabki duaaon ke saath bann gayi main Admin Head! Par asli khel toh abhi baaki tha, jiske baare me hum 8 naadan parindon ko koi idea nahi tha. There is nothing our senior council have not helped us with. Definitely can‚Äôt not give them an honorary mention. Apne bacchon jaise hi rakha, sab sikhaaya, chillaya, rulaya, par saath nahi chhoda. First project ke pehle ke jitters, major college events me TCET NSS UNIT ko represent karne ka pride, Sojourn me perform karne ki excitement, aur most importantly NSS Residential Camp organize karne ka pressure, shayad hum 8 council members humesha ke liye apne dil me bandh ke chalenge. It was tough par at the end of the day, volunteers ko enjoy karta dekh sab worth it lagne lag gaya. As Kamal says and I quote, ‚ÄúYehi baatein toh baadme yaad aayengi‚Äù. Pranali ka sabko taklu bulana, Tanisha ka chilla chillakar thak jaana, Aryan ka har jagah jaake tiffin khaana, Yash ka har cheez me bacchat karana, Mani ka hamesha mujhe bhajiya pav khaane leke jaana, Kamal ka SOM lab waala drama, Sumit ka daraane ke liye aankh dikhaana aur aakhir SABKA ek saath rehna. It is safe to say ki chaahe kuch yaad rahe na rahe, yeh cheeze hamesha rahengi. As this tremendously beautiful journey approaches it‚Äôs end on paper, I am proud to say that I would not have been the person I am today without NSS and everybody who has been a part of this journey with me. I am immensely grateful from the bottom of my very heart. ‚ÄúOnce a volunteer, always a volunteer‚Äù they said, ab samajh aane lag gaya hai kyu. And in the very end, I would like to thank me, for believing in me. Teehee. So much love and gratitude, now and always. Jai Hind!",

Aur ab aata hai NSS ka sab se best part jo ki 7 din ka camp hai, kisne socha tha ye 7 din life k sabse best moments me se ek hoge, itne maje kisi ne nahi kiye hoge, ye 7 din itna ache the ki ek baar wapis experience karna chahta hu mai, aur camp ki ek line jo koi nahi bhoolega i.e ‚ÄúRAATEIN BEET JATI HAI, YAADEIN YAAD AATI HAI !‚Äù ye poore college life ki one of the best memories me se ek hai. Aur hum sojourn ko kaise bhool sakte hai vo bhi 3rd // year k matlab ghaghra pehen k jo naache hai sab ladke shyd hi kahi kiya hoga kisi ne once in life time experience hai jo aur kahi nahi milega and council dance isse sabse jada dar tha but ye bhi hogaya thanks to tanisha and pranali jinhone NSS dance me char chand laga diye.NSS join karne k baad bahot kuch sikhne mila aur bahot dost bhi bane aur bahot achi memories bhi. Aur bhi bolna hai lekin ek page ki limit hai so yahi khatam karta hu. Thank you NSS for everything, my journey with NSS has been a fulfilling one, and I am proud to have been a part of such a noble cause. JAI HIND !!!!",

Kaafi log NSS 10 marks ke lia join krte h pr mera case alag tha muze bs mere comfortzone break karke socialize hona tha islia NSS join kia. NSS ne pehechan di kal tak koi nhi janta tha muze aaj har koi janta. NSS ka safar NSS special recruitment se chalu hua jiske baaremien phele koi idea nhi tha exactly kya hota mere case mein recruitment kaafi light gaya may be because mein dekhta serious huüòÇ.Mera phela offline project vaccination drive se chalu hua tha jo utna acha nhi tha usmein humare super council aye the aur hum unhe jaante nhi theüòÖ. First aur Second // year online tha so rarely kuch dost the NSS mein aane ke baad itne dosto baane ki abh count tak yaad nhi. Life mein jo jo nhi kia tha sabh NSS mein aakr kia Dance se lekr ghaghra se lekar CAMP ki planning tak and to be specific iss saal ka Soujourn ka Dance life ka phela dance tha mera. NSS ka phela // year toh almost pura online nikalgaya. Second // year chalu hote hi Council ka interview dia jo kia haadse jyadha bura gaya tha. Par by god grace mein Council bangaya. Council bante hi phela change was Mein , Muze to Hum, Hume Council baane ke baad phela month was dm hectic as sabh offline open horaha tha aur sabh kaam pile up hone laga tha par dheere dheere sabh normalise hogaya. NSS mein aakar Saath Sitaro ka saath mila Humesha josh mein rhene waale Kamal ka , Humesha chill dude rhene waale Maniii ka , Humesha calm minded rhene waale Patil Boi ka, Humesha Full charge rhene waali Hey Comps! ka (Pranali)‚ù§Ô∏è ,Humesha iphone se project ke photos click krne waali Tanisha ka, Humesha helmet lekar aane waale Sumit ka , Humesha Sobo vibes dene waali Charvu ka . Iss safar mein humare 8 ideals ko hum kabhi nhi bhulsakte Om, Khushi, Mayank, Priyanshu, Vaishnavi, Chhayank, Praveer, Rohit . NSS mein aakar actually letters, reports, files kaise banate hai vo sikha. NSS ne bhot saare naye dost, memories, experiences dia jo zindagi bhar kaam ayenge. NSS ne muze introvert se extrovert banadia. NSS ki journey ka sabhse best part hota NSS RESIDENTIAL CAMP jo iss saal hum finally gaye. Normally 75 volunteers jaate hai isbar hum 102 volunteers lekar gaye. Expectations se kaafi jyadha TE se support mila during the Camp. NSS Camp mein NSS FAMILY iss words ka actual meaning pata chala. Iss safar mein kaafi ups and down dikhe pr conclusion was that humesha koi na koi solution miljata tha. Yeh safar asani se kaatgaya kyuki sabh saath the UNITY thi aisi hi unity humesha maintain rahe. Aise hi TCET NSS UNIT desh ke prati apna yogdan dete rahe. Bas conclusion mein yaahi bolna chahunga jo legacy NSS ne itne saalose maintain ki hai vo humesha maintain rahe . JAI HIND !!!",

NSS is without a doubt our college's most formidable body, as evidenced by our effort and zeal, but don't mistake this strength for a lack of enjoyment. My time as a volunteer has been the most fun I've had in // years. From debate competitions to Old age home visits, from blood donations to The ELECTRIC Sojourn Dance, NSS has given me a variety of settings and opportunities to strengthen my ability to balance my need to serve others with my need to have a good time. It is here that I have witnessed my efforts make a significant difference in the lives of the needy, as well as where I have witnessed perfect strangers become best friends. Aise hi nahi hum khudko family ka title dete hai, when I needed it, I had a stronghold of 200 volunteers on my side, which is what every college student hopes for. Even if my official volunteer status has ended (once a volunteer, always a volunteer), my connection to NSS simply grows deeper with time. I will be grateful to my dependable councils and my fellow volunteers forever and always.",

NSS not only gave me an opportunity to contribute to society but also learn how to be confident and deal with people. And how can we forget Sojourn, it will always be one of my favorite memories of NSS. As for the projects, there are too many to go on about, so I‚Äôm going to talk about my favorite project which was the ashram visit- it was such a wonderful experience seeing all the elderly laugh and enjoy with us.

From the day of recruitment, it was journey of fun and bonding, from being the Harry Potter, dancer, singer for my family everything I loved here. I also remember ki online me ghar me baith ke hume social activities karni padhi jo ki society me jhadu lagana ho ya raat ko baithke skit ki preparation ho ya road par awareness baatna ho sab ne mujhe kuch sikhaya aur banaya hai. Online ke wajh se seniors ke saat itna time spend karne nhi mila par jab mile tho bohot maze kiye humne saat me. Jab hum TE bane hum par responsibility aagayi thi ki hame humare SE ko bhi waise pyaar dena hai jese hume humare senior se mila, par humein kar dikhaya ek saat aakar recruitment ho ya sojourn dance sabme humne machaya hai. Mere zindagi ka pehela Camp aur sabse badiya camp, ek thali me khana ho ya ek saat masti karna sab aaj bhi yaad karne me hasi aati hai. Jab join kiya tha NSS me Discipline dekh ke laga tha kab khatam hoga ye NSS par aaj sochta hu kyu khatam hua ye NSS.

        "NSS'' whenever I hear this name I just remember my selection day, when everything was boring in online mode and I got this zoom link for nss selections. I went there and it was a totally different atmosphere altogether, where we used to get strong, got several tasks to do. And after entering NSS the first thing we all got introduced with was the word FAMILY. It was an incredible fun ride and the most lovely bond ever shared where we all really got along to help needy people, to enjoy ourselves after the project.Through NSS we all learned discipline, Punctuality, Values. As I'm talking about family bonds, I want to go back to some memories of NSS Camp. I Still Remember those days which were so evolving for all of us, most of us got along in those 7 days where we really got to know what exactly NSS is all about. The strictness, fun we had without spending a single time searching for mobile phones was awesome. It was fully a phone detoxification, we never thought there would be such fun in camp. It was Once in a lifetime moment, which will stay forever with us. It's emotional to write this last feedback when I really grew up from rookie in college to being Senior with NSS . I will end this feedback saying I Really Don't want this journey to end ever, As we say ONCE A VOLUNTEER ALWAYS A VOLUNTEER JAI HIND.",

        "Let's start from our selection. I was so excited to be a part of the NSS family. The fun began at the start of the recruitment days. While entering NSS when we were in SE we entered as an individual but after that we were made united by our Council and TE volunteers. From blood donation camp and old age home to actually Nss 7 days camp it was very daunting for me. Being a part of NSS not only made me aware of people's problems and their experience but it's also made me act and confident to fix their problems. I just love the slogan of Who are we ?? NSS while clicking the photo. Special Thanks to our Council who had put so much effort into bringing people together and creating a family. I loved working on projects and especially the making posters (not good at this but i tried well my best). Another best part of our NSS is the NSS dance our cultural event Sojourn we all gathered everyday before the final performance and we have created a great memories for life. The only place where I felt equality. That affection, those million-dollar smiles, the bond with them is something like an asset to me. I know this may sound boring as it is too long. But, this was the best experience of my life. I have spent my nss journey with the best people. Blessed with the best.",

From the recruitment to the way NSS rules were taught to us till the last project, it has been a great journey throughout. I am quite struck by the incredible experiences I‚Äôve had, the lessons I've learned, and the relationships I've formed.During SE we had a few projects online then after a few months the offline projects started. I still remember how I have been late for each project and was scolded for the same. NSS is not just about strictness, everything eventually ends up with fun and amazing memories only. NSS has taught me punctuality and discipline. I never thought I would start working with people who were initially just like any other volunteer to me but have ended up becoming a FAMILY. Our batch was fortunate enough to experience the NSS Camp. This is one of the things which will be unforgettable. Each day brought new experiences that one never had. Not to forget the NSS Dance Rehearsals during sojourn. The amount of fun and Bonds formed during it can match no level. Kudos to the current council as well, they performed a splendid job. The memories created together will always hold a special place in my heart. The bonds formed will only grow stronger. JAI HIND!",

        "JAI HIND! The reasons why I signed up to become an NSS Volunteer 2021-23 could probably be put to words, but what I got back from NSS‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs beyond just words - it‚Äôs a feeling  Well to get started I was very bored. I among many others started my engineering life in dire times where we were more concerned about ourselves than trying to do cool stuff students are supposed to do in colleges according to Bollywood (Student Of The // year is a lie). I wasn‚Äôt very socially active with what was happening in my online college, but I finally decided to do something about it, right after all bodies in the college closed off their membership forms! It‚Äôs when I found out about TCET NSS UNIT and what everything looked more appealing to me than the college admissions itself. Without having any idea of what I was signing up for, every twists and turns in my volunteer-ship was filled with surprises and some of the fantastic moments of my life: whether it was the recruitment or making a difference around my society - online AND offline, participating in various projects which mattered a lot to the people I wouldn‚Äôt have met otherwise, the feedbacks, the bonding with fellow volunteers regardless of // year and department, and becoming a part of THE NSS FAMILY. From recruitment to being the SE volunteers struggling to turn on our cameras, to attending my first offline project of vaccination drive ‚Äì from becoming the Lazy Buddies to rocking the stage at Sojourn (TWICE) ‚Äì from being the ones who got recruited to becoming to ones who recruited ‚Äì from giving the NSS CAMP's FOMO to attending the 7-day NSS CAMP ‚Äì there are too many words, people, and memories to fit this page, but here are the ones who are responsible for making these two // years INCREDIBLE: Bhavik, Vishakha, Ameya, Ashmit, Shantanu and Aashvi ‚Äì for making the first volunteers I ever interacted with worth it and recruiting me into NSS which brought out my spirit of a volunteer. Om, Khushi, Mayank, Priyanshu, Vaishnavi, Chhayank, Praveer and Rohit ‚Äì the eight pair of shoulders who introduced us to various projects and ensured we had the best memories starting with our offline projects. Kamal, Tanisha, Aryan, Charvi, Maniprakash, Pranali, Sumit and Yash ‚Äì providing us TE volunteers with various opportunities during recruitment and projects as well as bringing us our best memories of all time in the NSS Camp!

        "Jai Hind! These two // years of my life where I was the part of NSS family was incredibly grateful. In these 2 // years I learned 3 things discipline, punctuality and respecting others.In these span I have earned many friends, well I can‚Äôt say friends but now they are my family, my NSS family. I also learned how to work for society selflessly, ‚ÄùNot me but You‚Äù ,and how to find happiness in small things. I honestly was an introvert person but from the day 1, from recruitment process to last project I have noticed a drastic change in myself, I have turned into an extrovert person, a person who loves to be with peoples, who loves to talk a lot. NSS has taught me, wait gaa ke sunati hu ‚ÄúKisi ki muskurahaton pe ho nisar,Kisi ka dard mil sake to Ie udhaar‚Äù that is to be someone‚Äôs reason for happiness, a reason to bring smile on their face, stand for someone who is in pain and be there support system, old age home visit where we tried cheering them up and tried to bring smile on there face. Talking about Sojourn, performance ka pata nahi but practice time were worth remembering, voh masti voh dance voh ‚Äúsamosa samosa‚Äù voh sab I will really gonna miss. Lastly about the camp, use bare mai kya hi bolu ‚Äúwoh din bhi kya din the‚Äù, vaise toh ‚Äúwhat happens in NSS stays in NSS‚Äù but still I can say etna ki voh morning exercise, voh village tak chal ke jana, voh sath mai ek plate mai share kar ke khana, voh raat to games ka session, voh DJ night, voh punishments, aur bahut kuch, but sabse jyada yaad aayegi voh room ke andar wali memories, voh dumb sharas, voh bathroom ke liye bricking‚Äôs. Seriously those 7 days were the best. And finally, about the councils who seems very strict, but were the actual shield for us, pata nahi kitna suna hoga unhone ne humari wajah se, kitne consequences jhele hai pata nahi, but yes, they were the great leaders always stood for us. Now that my journey is ending with NSS, Naina Talwar(YJHD) kaa dialogue yaad aa raha hai,‚ÄùTakleef hui lekin iss baar khushi bhi thi ki apne saath wapas yaadon ka ek bada sa suitcase le jaa rahi thi‚Ä¶jinhein mai kabhi nahi bhul paungi‚Äù. Feeling bad ki journey khatam ho rahi hai but those beautiful memories will always gonna stay with me, and I doubt I would ever forget it. But ‚ÄúOnce a volunteer always a volunteer‚Äù so abhi toh nahi chod rahi mai NSS ka sath. Honestly speaking these 2 // years were the best part of my engineering // years. I will miss my NSS nuclear family. There is no goodbyes for us though, u all will always be in my heart! Jai Hind!",

        "Toh chaliye shuru karte hai‚Ä¶ The journey in NSS is like a roller coaster of emotions (the real NAVRAS) and a slideshow of memories for me. Right from the recruitment days it was clear that it was not like some ordinary committee/club but it was something different, something way more interesting. NSS taught us the true meaning and importance of discipline and unity, while also providing complementary fun and joyful moments. I cannot imagine how monotonous and dull engineering would be if I hadn‚Äôt been a part of NSS. Being the JC was also an amazing expedition which obviously came along with lots of work, but it‚Äôs amazing how such tedious work didn‚Äôt feel hectic (thoda bohot lagta tha but nvm) I guess credit goes to my fellow JCs and our dear Council. The best part started when the things began in offline mode from SOJOURN Dance to NSS ki Holi to SE recruitment to the residential camp and much more, each and every event was filled with sheer uncertainty and unexpectedness. I hope that the legacy of the TCET NSS UNIT continues for future batches so that they also could be a part of this one of a kind experience. Ab saari cheezein toh nahi bata sakta idhar because ‚ÄúWhat happens in NSS stays in NSS''.

        "The BEST thing that happened in my engineering life was getting recruited into TCET NSS UNIT, NSS has given me many things. I wasn't sure where to start or what to say, but I'll try to cover most of my experiences. In the first phase of our recruitment where our colleges were in online mode, our seniors connected with us via Zoom/google meetings jaha humara recruitment ho raha tha and I was totally shocked ki ye kya ho raha hai, like everyone knows ki NSS ka recruitment sabse alag and hatke hota hai but humari batch jo sirf admission ki procedure ke liye college aayi thi baki we had no clue about anything, at first, the activities like namak khana and singing felt like torture, but we soon realized that those were the moments that brought us closer together. Somehow I got recruited into TCET NSS UNIT because maine meeting me Rohit Yadav jo hamare council the ( i didn‚Äôt knew of course sab logo ne random names se rename kya tha) unko hi cross question kar liya tha and itna hi nhi also I was elected as junior council for TCET NSS UNIT on 31/08/2021. And there I started my journey for NSS. In the beginning, it was very tough for me to work in the online mode that too with all unknowns but all thanks to our 8 councils and of course JC BOYZZ Aryan & Sahil. Working with them never felt like I was working with strangers, despite the online format. We developed a great bond(late night meetings IYKYK ). I still remember 18th Feb 2022, which was my first offline project about which I was super excited, because I was always eager to attend offline projects. I still remember it was Blood Donation Camp in collaboration with Lions Club and on my first project, I committed a mistake by wearing NSS t-shirt before the start of the project ‚ò†Ô∏è . Later, we met all the other volunteers in person, whom we had only seen in online meetings. It was great to finally put faces to names, like 'Oh, you're Samridhh!üòÇ. Most of our journey of the second // year was completed in online mode, but there were a few moments that we can't forget. One is Sojourn where we set the stage on fire with our passion and energy. I still remember that 1 minute 50 seconds of our performance as SE was my first and best dance performance(Top Lessi poddi ), special thanks to Krutish, Vishakha, Ashvi and all TE who helped us to set that dance, and then there comes Holi 2k22 , where we were surprised by our TE and council members which was AWESOME ‚≠ê and with lots of new friends we completed our tenure as SE Volunteers. Then, as we started attending offline projects, we met everyone and our bond with everyone was getting stronger. The best memory of TE was NSS CAMP ‚ù£Ô∏è, that one week, one hundred connections, one thousand emotions, one lakh jokes, and one million memories from 12/01/23 to 18/01/23 will always be carved into everyone‚Äôs heart. We spent a whole week without phones or the internet, and it was scary how quickly time flew by. With great pleasure, I am writing this feedback for our TCET NSS UNIT. As a NSS Volunteer 2021-23, I have had the opportunity to serve the community and positively impact the lives of people around me. The journey has been a fulfilling one, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to everyone who has been a part of it. The two // years of my journey with NSS have been nothing short of awesome. It has been a wonderful experience working alongside like minded individuals who share a passion for service and a commitment to making a difference in the world. From organizing blood donation camps and health drives to conducting awareness campaigns and environmental initiatives, every activity has been a rewarding and enriching experience that has helped me grow both personally and professionally. I was an introvert in my first // year, but just because of the opportunities I got from NSS and, of course, constant support from my councils, I developed lots of soft skills. I even got a chance to become Joint Discipline Secretary of TCET only because of NSS and the exposure I got from NSS being a junior council. Thank You Chhayank, Khushi, Mayank, Om, Praveer, Priyanshu, Rohit, and Vaishnavi for giving me this opportunity to be a part of this great NSS FAMILY. Once a Volunteer, always a Volunteer.

The time I spent with the council members and the volunteers will always be in the best moments of my college life.

I am really grateful to them to make us such selfless volunteers.. Nss ke first year se leke abhi tak unka khauf hai.. but they were and will be best guides.

The journey was full of scary scoldings from the council, laughing on each other's dumb mistakes, sharing an unbreakable bond with each other, selfless attitude, improvement in personality, owning up actions, becoming the council, experiencing the stressed conditions during the projects and team work.

        "JAI HIND ! NSS ka Safarnama: ‚ÄúMaine socha na tha ye kaise ho gaya, NSS se mera yu Rishta judd gaya. NSS mei apno sa pyaar mila, sach mei mujhe ek pyara sa parivaar mila.‚Äù Let's start from the beginning and tell you all the reason behind me getting into NSS. College mei aate hi sabse pehla interaction koi social body se hua tha to wo NSS tha. Hame College ke piche ABL activity ke liye survey karwane leke gaye the and tabhi one of the volunteer( jinka naam muje aaj tak nahi pataüòÖüòÖ) se mera interaction hua tha. And believe me jo impress hua tha mei I was like aur kuch ho na ho NSS volunteer jarur banna hai. Recruitment in NSS for me was kind off easy kyuki jyada kuch mujse pucha nahi gaya maine ek do ans kiye aur wo log utne mei hi mujse impress ho gaye(mei apni ab aur kya hi badhai karuüòÇüòÇ). And after getting recruited it was never looking back. Bhale hi hamara pura SE, NSS mei, online raha ho but iss online mode mei bhi jo mazza aaya hai uska koi javab nahi. Chahe wo projects karne ho chahe interaction with SE ya hamare TE volunteers se karna ho, har baat ka experience kuch alag hi tha. Start mei council ne bola tha infact TE ne bhi bola tha ki NSS is different from other social or professional bodies par tabhi iss baat pe dhyan nahi gaya par jab experience kiya to laga ki isse badhiya body be it social or professional koi nahi ho sakti. Hamare council kaafi strict the no doubt but unse jo sikhne mila it will be with me forever. First year NSS ka kaise nikal gaya samajh hi nahi aaya council ki daat sunte sunte and unko follow karte karte hame realise hi nahi hua ki ab hamari baar aa gayi hai Council banne ki. I was way impressed by our council and aisa tha mann mei ki ab jab council banne ke liye interview hoga to bhale hi i am under confident and scared but still mei jaunga and give it try. Laga tha ki interview process wahi boring sa hoga but jab interview shuru hua to pata chala ki ye koi aam interview nahi hai. The best interview process ever I would say. And fir ban gaya Council. Mere department ke bahar koi dost nahi the but jab in 7 logo se baat hui to laga ki banenge bhi nahiüòÇüòÇ. Sab alag nature ke koi shant to koi gussa karne wala koi disciplined to koi kaam ke bich mei time pass karne wala. And me being an introvert mujhe laga tha pura saal ab aise hi nikalna padega inke saath. Par fir dheere dheere jo bond bana inke saath jo understanding build hui jo masti kiya inke saath matlab kya hi bolu ek dum out of this world wala experience. Fir projects ki baari aayi, jab hamare councils project karwata tha tab kabhi realize nahi hua ki project karwana is way harder than khud project karna. But wo bhi ek awesome experience tha. Hamare SE ka recruitment ki to baat hi alag thi aur waha se shuru hua tha hamare council banne ke baad ka safar. Ha ye to hai ki shuru to sab online mode mei hi hua tha but jaise hi offline projects karne ka mauka mila hum council to uss mauke pe tut pade. And volunteers bhi kam nahi the unhone bhi dono haato se ye mauke ka fayda uthaya and projects kiye. Fir aaya So-journ. uff So-journ ka experience was the best ever. Dance karne nahi aata tha(wo to abhi bhi nahi aataüòÖüòÖ) but fir bhi dance kiya and hum sab ke bich jo bonding hui iss dauran wo epic tha. Agar offline projects ya offline interaction ka experience share karne jau to shayad ek do page aur bhar jayenge. But kyuki baaki council ko bhi likhne ki jagah chahiye isliye mei abhi ke liye bas karta hu. Being a NSS volunteer was the best thing that happened to me till date in college. And sharing such an important position with these 7 best people was awesome. Chahe kuch yaad rahe ya na rahe ye 2 saal hamesha yaad rahenge and in sab ko mei kabhi nahi bhul paunga. Thank you NSS for everything, jo kuch bhi life lessons mile hai uska bahot bahot dhanyawad.‚ú®‚ô•Ô∏è JAI HIND !  ",

I still remember our very first induction program of NSS where our Council that given us an intro kind of thing about NSS- full roadies vibes itna strict, itna disciplined. Then recruitment toh pata hi hoga NSS kya baap hota hai, sabse alag sabse hatke full mazzaa‚ú®. Uske baad se toh kya hi batau kahi projects me toh itna zyada mazza aaya hai kya hi batau. Projects toh hote rehte the but ussme jo dost banaye hai meine, poora 75 ka unit ek saath hogaya tha( being an introvert this is a big deal for meüòÇ). Although our batch was apparently the COVID batch but humne koi kam mazze nahi kiya and thanks to our Council jinhone aise projects rakhe ki buss kabhi bore hone hi nahi diya( chhae vo project se pehle ho yaa baadme vo sunanae wala session baap tha) aur ha projects keliye Sunday bohot neend ka balidaan bhi hua haiüòÇ. Apne TE ke saath interaction toh full alag hi vibe leke aata tha- ha TE toh hum hai but vo humare TE hamesha rahenge‚ù§Ô∏è. Fir aaya humara second year, aur kisne socha tha ki vo shaant shaant ladki jo projects me kam bolti thi vo Council banegiüòÇ but yes bangayi. Council banke bohot kuch seekha especially mere saath jo 7 Council the unsee. Pehle toh yeh logh aise lage the Khushi- strict JC, Om- throwball partner jisne aunty pe ball maara tha, Rohit bohot kaam dene wala, Priyanshu- dept ka bitching partner, Praveer- placement ka bt denewala, Chhayankkaam se kaam rakhne wala hasmukh and Maayank-sirf party party bolne wala se and now they are the best and sabse pyaare logh jinke saath bohot hi zyaada mazza aaya ( they are still the same thoughüòÇ). Ek saal me itna accha bond bangaya hai humara ki kya hi bole. Vo rozka ka zagda aur group se nikalna masti masti me fir end of the day ek saath sab zagda bhulke masti karke saath me hona was the best part. Jab actual Council bane dusre saal tabh pata chala online projects rakhne ki majboori aur tabh actually pata chala ki Council gussa kyu hota tha. Humare pyaare SE kya hi batau, bolne keliye shabd hi nahi hai- harkate hi aise karte the but unhone jo ek unit ka maan rakha hai and aage bhi aise hi NSS ki legacy leke jaayenge uskeliye full respect. Offlline projects were the best part(jiska hume bohot hi zyada intezaar tha)‚ú®. Pata hi nahi chala yeh saal kaise beeth gaya but iss baat ki toh khushi hai ki atleast kuch toh offline karke gaye. Camp ki toh bohot zyada umeed thi but koi naah bina camp gaye yaade bhi acchi banali hai humne‚ù§Ô∏è. How could I even forget the best part- SOJOURN. Bohot memories banayi hai, vo poora hafta was the best- dance practice se lekar performance day tak sab best tha‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®. I am genuinely gonna miss everything about NSS. From attending the Zoom sessions full stress me aake to Council ki daant sunna to khudh Council banke volunteers ke mazze lenaüòÇ. But jo bhi bolo these wouldn't have been possible without mere 7 Council, kya hota mera tumare bina . Lockdown me guzara wouldn't have been possible without NSS( although kabh kabhi lagta tha zyada hi projects horahe soona hai yeh voüòÇ) but memories jo banayi hi humne-mashallah. Dekha jaaye toh likhne keliye bohot kuch hai but pehla feedback hai iska matlab yeh nahi sab in detail bol du kyuki- What happens in NSS, stays in NSSüòÇ. JAI HIND ! ",

        "JAI HIND ! Just to be clear this is my First Ever Feedback in the journey of NSS, and I am glad to be giving the feedback as a Council. üòå As we all know we are the so called CORONA BATCH, but our particular Unit from NSS too, is the CORONA UNIT as our seniors too got more offline exposure and our juniors will also surely get all upcoming projects in online mode. (Humse ki kuch khaas lagav tha ishwar ko ). Ab kya hi kar sakte hain yeh sochke poora man lagake projects complete kiye, council ki daant khaaye aur dekhte hi dekhte TCET ka sabse bada aur pyaar ek NSS PARIVAAR ban gaya . Council ne 3 cheezen sikhayi thi - 3 Principles of NSS, DISCIPLINE, PUNTUALITY & RESPECT and following all these principles will eventually make all the volunteers unite which is true. Talking about SE ka journey, I feared and respected our Councils a lot and did all my projects with utmost sincerity because (Council ka daant na khaana pade üòÇ ), humare TE sabse best the, who always motivated us and helped us throughout the projects (Jaldi karo Council dekhenge toh chillaienge). Looking at these motivated seniors and also our batchmates bonding very well was one of the best parts jo bahot yaad aaienge. I will always be greatfull to have got the wonderfull oppurtunity of serving as the NSS COUNCIL in my TE, after 3 Stages of Interview (which is the most in any body of TCET ), and after becoming the COUNCIL the way people, especially NSS Volunteers will look at you totally changes. (NSS COUNCIL main hai bhai watt toh hai kaafi izzat hai inki). Apart from this the main motivation was our SE, (SE ke baccho pe sabse zyada dhyaan dena hai NSS ka future wahi honge, unko acche se sab kuch sikhana hai #legacy must go on) from recruiting them to teaching them basic values and legacies of NSS, ek ek kaam ke peeche sabne bahot mehnat aur efforts liye hain. TCET main rehke NSS Recruitment nahi experience kiya toh kya TCETian banoge tum , ekdum Roadiess Feelzz. Major Events jaise Republic Day, Vaccination Drive, Blood Donation Camp, Old Age Home Visit, Awareness in Singh Estate jo NSS ka main chehra aur focus rehte hain woh humne apne UNIT pe ekdum acche sur sabhya tareeke se complete kiya, iss samay samajh aa gaya ki yeh volunteers masti ke saath saath kaam bhi ekdum acche se karte hain, NSS Volunteers ke Discipline aur Puntuality ke charche poore TCET main hain . Having made so many memories and given so much efforts for this unit, it is really painful that this all is finally coming to an end. (As told by our Councils ‚ÄúYeh ek saal kaise nikal jaiega na pata bhi nahi chalega ek ek moment enjoy karo aur poori mehnat se kaam karo‚Äù ) Will always remember each and every volunteer of our unit, SE aur TE dono ne bahot daant bhi khaayi hai, gusse wala look bhi dekha hai aur saath diya hai poora saal üòÇ. This journey was really filled with many ups and downs but the ones who always were by my side were my Council Mates ‚ÄúKhushi, Mayank, Om, Chhayank, Praveer, Priyanshu & Vaishnavi‚Äù. You guys made it seem like a cakewalk for us, people will never know how hectic and complicated it was the way we handled it.

I would say that all the TE would agree with me on the fact that NSS Sojourn dance was one of the best parts of our time as NSS volunteers.

The best part about NSS is that it gives Me the opportunity to talk to the people from the different social strata ‚Äî the poor, the rich, the needy, the humiliated, the successful ones, the struggling ones and many more. And I learn something or the other from every one of them I meet. Also understand how our society is knit, which no University in the country can teach us through the textbooks and syllabus. I came to know that I'm a privileged boy because there were my friends who came from the remotest places to the nearby towns and cities for the sake of education. I learnt how hard they worked to get better lives for themselves and their families. I found out the depressing fact that the things we consider as daily necessities are luxuries to many people out there. I learnt how better we can be as humans if we can live harmoniously. After joining I have become more confident, optimistic and hopeful about the future. I have gained some very beautiful souls in my life as friends because of NSS. I became more fascinated about my country and that motivated me to think creatively. It helped me to enhance and enrich my intellect as well. I can surely say that NSS taught me more than the textbooks did. It taught me to live life happily and make others lives happier. Help as much as you can. Be compassionate and be kind to others.

        "'JAI HIND ! ‚Äú NSS ‚Äù is a prestigious and a revered name for its social service and the plethora of activities along with its discipline.' This was typically heard by me rather the only thing known about NSS to me was this. It was the pandemic year 2020 and the NSS volunteers selection was up. I already was a part of NSS in my mind as I imagined myself in the NSS T-shirt doing various stuff. It has all been fun right from the day of our recruitment, where we did all sorts of stuff that is not at all expected in any recruitment process. This is the unique procedure that NSS follows while recruiting its volunteers and I wouldn't disclose it and be a spoiler for the aspiring volunteers. But there's one thing for sure, the recruitment procedure was in itself a teaching class by our TE volunteers where they were indirectly telling us about the organization, the protocol, etc. Although it was fun altogether as the recruitment continued for 4 hours and what we did in those hours? Umm.. hmm... ‚Äú What happens in NSS , Stays in NSS üòé ‚Äù There was a fearful atmosphere initially may be due to strict discipline that our councils enforced. I feared them personally but to my amazement they all turned out to be super cool when we interacted offline. This was a completely different side of the same coin. Although most of our projects have been online due to Corona, our councils have not left any stone unturned in making the most of the available situation in making projects interactive and interesting. We made the most efficient use of the online platform. The projects in NSS have always taught me some or the other thing, be it from our very first activity of mask making, when I learnt stitching. It wouldn't be wrong if I say NSS has reactivated those long slept creative nerves of mine. It has also taught me that any work done needs feedback and giving detailed feedback is indeed an art and more than just complementing. NSS also provides its volunteers numerous opportunities to come forward and improve themselves. I received a similar one through ‚Äú NIC ‚Äù . I been selected for it from our district but under some uncontrollable circumstances, i couldn't make it. The point here is that along with social work in environment, education, health, etc domains , NSS has always been in the forefront for uplifting the society and its volunteers. I have earned a bunch of people through NSS and it feels so warm and cozy when we say ,‚Äú We are a family, NSS family.‚Äù Talking about projects, I liked all our projects but to be specific I loved all the offline projects the most. Right from the traffic management project to the visit to the old age. Another best part of NSS is the NSS dance in our cultural event , ‚ÄúSojourn‚Äù . We gathered everyday before the final performance for the practice and have created memories for life. The fun, the long practices, the scoldings from the council, the sweaty faces, the laughs and gigs, the disagreements at some points, the NSS's special samosa and frooty treat have been an indispensable part of my NSS memory.‚ù§Ô∏è JAI HIND !

        "JAI HIND ! I started off with my journey in NSS in the middle of the first wave when online lectures were meant to be skipped and when everyone was still enjoying the prolonged ‚Äúvacation‚Äù. From the eccentric recruitment process of a type we'll never see again, I was in for a ride which was going to change me forever! Firstly it was all very confusing, we didn't understand the importance of all the rules and strictness but as the year started progressing the pieces of the puzzle started coming together and I saw progress in my own self! Back then we were in the ‚ÄúCovid-19 will end in a month or two and we'll get the full experience of NSS!!‚Äù  little knowledge of fate's plans but that didn't stop us from doing meaningful projects and enjoying and bonding with our fellow volunteers, learning about the various government schemes, promoting various social topics etc. And when we finally did get an offline project where we showed off posters to the vehicles passing by promoting the road rules, it lived up to all the expectations from the nine months of anticipation! The year ended and we transitioned from ‚Äúbahu‚Äù to ‚Äúsaas‚Äù and it was time for us to live the journey from the other side, we started teaching the lessons we were taught and in turn revised those lessons ourselves. Thankfully we also got the last few months offline, where we enjoyed the dance in the Sojourn festival which was a result of rigorous practice of two weeks. Looking back, it still makes me sad that we lost many of the opportunities like the camp and other offline events but I'm still grateful I could be a part of the journey. And believe me when I say that all of the craziness (which was filled with 200% love and efforts) would never be seen again in my life! TCET NSS is something which I'll never forget in my lifetime :) JAI HIND ! ",

        "JAI HIND ! So the time has come to give the ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù but feedback of mine with respect to NSS. The main obstacle is from where should I begin?‚Ä¶right from the beginning is always better. So let‚Äôs get on with my mesmerizing journey with NSS. So it all started when I was promoted from First Year to Second Year and my batch was sent an introductory message with some insights along with a NSS recruitment registration form. Now at that point of time I was a bit nervous as at that time there were many other social clubs and technical teams giving their respective insights and etc and all this was done simultaneously which caused a bit of nervousness. But I chose to try the NSS recruitment process for the reason being that I wanted to work with a social body once and there was no other better chance than with NSS. All the registration and stuff was done and an orientation was held for better understanding and perks of NSS. Now this orientation was not just an ordinary orientation, which will be understood in later parts. After the orientation in the morning all the ones registered were called in a meeting in the evening just to give a brief that recruitment process can be started at any point of time which indirectly caused waves of nervousness. Then I got to know we were allocated in different groups along with our seniors which were already a part of NSS. Now I was scared as to what they were going to do with us. Already this much being said I wouldn‚Äôt like to spoil the curiosity of the new upcoming volunteers who would be reading this as there is a famous saying which comes back in mind: ‚ÄòWhat happens in NSS Stays in NSS‚Äô. You guys will be versed with the process by your seniors and I would just like to add that this recruitment process is just of a different kind. My first year in NSS was a special year for the world which was 2020. Due to the global pandemic mine batch was not able to get experience of offline projects except the unofficial meet which was a bang!. But in all this mist kudos to our council who always tried their level best to give us real NSS experience in online mode. Also kudos to our fun-loving TE who always entertained us in online meets and I had a great time with them on meets too but more so in the unofficial meet. So the year passed and after successful completion of required hours I was promoted to the second year of NSS and officially as TE. So till now it would have been pretty obvious that it was time for a payback of what we had to do and go through in our recruitment process and the same or in different methods to be done with our SE. Although most of the SE whom I have met till now are great in nature but would like to mention here the members which were part of the recruitment process of GROUP 7. Now this was my first interaction with the juniors as the previous year being held online, and it was surely a great start. Mine SE recruitment process as well as TE recruitment process are well high among the list of great memories with and in NSS. I got and took my chance well to get revenge and hope the legacy continues. The same story repeats of the projects being online due to pandemic but with a glimpse of hope of some of our projects being in offline mode. In all this, the first unofficial meet with SE was held offline which was just great and got to know my juniors pretty well which only continued further with some projects starting to get offline like the Homage Ceremony and Republic Day Celebration. My best experience with NSS was still yet to come which came in the first week of March when we were called up to participate in SOJOURN. These 2-3 weeks were just awesome and were able to fulfill the last 2 years of difficulty in college life. Practice sessions in the morning in a class as well as on the ground were great. NSS dance in sojourn for me was special because not only TE but also the SE as well as our TE i.e BE were also able to participate in the same dance as part of NSS which shows great sense of unity. In terms of NSS projects the offline ones will definitely be mine favorite and with best experience and memories without any doubt. Mine best projects in terms of experience would easily be The Old Age Home Visit and Awareness Project on Government Schemes. The only loss for me was to not experience more offline projects and the Camp. But this loss for the most part won‚Äôt be greater than the memories, experience and bond that has been formed in NSS in the past two years and would wish it to get better and stronger in years to come.

        "JAI HIND ! Firstly, I would like to tell you something about myself before I ever join any committee. I was not a fervent person. Never to deny the fact that I was also very less social... However, I tried to manage being quote and quote antisocial for some of the years of my life. Now this I wanted to change, so I got to learn about some of the committees in our college. One of them was the National Service Scheme. I was introduced to this committee in one of the seminars our college conducted. In that seminar, the speaker gave us an impeccable overview of the committee. I was very intrigued by the whole seminar, which made me wish to join this committee. One year later, we got the opportunity to sit through the interview process where I had the most fun. It was literally by far the best interview session I ever gave. We were questioned and given tasks by our seniors themselves, where they also shared some of the valuable lessons they learned during their tenure as an SE volunteer. I still remember how they made us eat salt. It still makes me laugh, but an important lesson that was behind the whole process was team ethics, that until your council gives you the permission to eat or take a break, you cannot disrespect the code of ethics of this committee. Nevertheless, the whole experience is still noted down in the sweet memory of my mind. The uniqueness of every project made the whole experience more special and made us more enthusiastic. When we became TE volunteers, we got the chance to take the interview of our juniors and we tried our level best to make the whole process as special as our seniors made it for us. Hope I am still their favorite TE volunteer...The friendships, the bond like a family will never be forgotten in my entire life. The TCET NSS unit molded me into a better person with a stronger and responsible character and I hope I will follow all the values I got to learn in these two wonderful years I served as a volunteer.

Following the footsteps of the former Council, the Council of the current year has performed a splendid job in creating a 'unit' despite the unfortunate confinement to online interactions. This made the few offline projects and meets towards the end so impactful and the perfect cherry on the top. This unmistakably includes the NSS Dance rehearsals. The two most important lessons that will live with me throughout my life are discipline and the ability to say yes to all and every opportunity undeterred by unpreparedness. More importantly, it taught us that a comma is followed by a space. Fun wasn't taught in NSS. It just happened to be a result nonetheless. It is funny how easy it is to get nostalgic over the little time we have spent together. Little, considering the limited offline experiences we have had. Little also meaning not enough. This was evident every time that there was an unofficial activity conducted. The ones which were intended to instill values but invariably brought us closer together. Wistful longing for the time amongst everyone in the family always existed. Now it will only grow stronger. JAI HIND !  ",

Coming to the second year of NSS, this year was something else. The most fun part was to recruit juniors where I asked some of them to eat salt as punishment because they didn't obey the rules of NSS during recruitment. I also made one junior member dance and recite poems for almost forty-five minutes and then made him sing too. Apart from the recruitment process we all know what was the best part, it was NSS dance(ghagra dance), loads of practice, and so many memories created in such a short span of time.

From the blood donation camp to the NSS dance during Sojourn, being a TE was a total blast. Not to forget how it all started in the second year of our Engineering when we freshly had adjusted with the online mode. I could not have known the people if it had not been for NSS. Our council taught us what fear was, what actual discipline is, how great nss is, if not were for online. never got the chance to interact with our seniors that much but once when we did meet it was so fun. They taught us how to behave in a project and to be disciplined when wearing the NSS T-shirt and respect it. The project which I loved the most was our visit to the Old age home, we played several games, sang and danced. They shared their life stories of what they did for a living and enjoyed it very much.

But being honest we could tell no less how fun it was to us in that pandemic times. Getting on the screen, doing fun activities, getting reminders for name formats, Turning the videos on, but in that giving feedback was the fun part. The council we had during our SE or our TE, seeing them putting the efforts to bring interesting activities, fun meet-ups and most to all getting us to talk to each other during the start, was unbelievable. Believe me when I say I had 12 people to talk to in the start, but now I can proudly say I can. Nss has given us so much to tell, which these pages might never be able to sum up. JAI HIND !

      Testimony:
        "JAI HIND! Starting in NSS was one of the most daunting things I have done in SE. I believe we entered as individuals but were made a unit by our council and TE. Various projects, meetings and tasks were completed each making us better as people. As we became TE we had the greatest work of filling in the shoes of those before us. We all worked collectively for it. Through the project and pandemic, spirits held high and finally when offline projects approached, we tried to compensate as much as we could. Projects were always amazing, but nothing compares to NSS dance in Sojourn. It will be one of the fondest memories of NSS that I will cherish for a very long time. It was an honor to be a part of something so wonderful. And I'm deeply grateful to everyone who has made this journey special. Shout-out to our previous council- Abhishek, Khushi, Kirti, Priyal, Sreyas, Sunil, Varsha and Viraj for an amazing SE. Extending thanks to Sakshi, Mukta, Meet, Janhavi, Dhruv, Jayesh, Radhika, Khyaati, Nivedita for being the wonderful TE that you were. And special mentions to Advait, Vishakha, Akshata, Bhagwat and Krutish for making the Sojourn dance so special. Lastly, big thanks to my council who made all of it possible this year. Thanks Chhayank, Khushi, Mayank, Om, Praveer, Priyanshu, Rohit and Vaishnavi. Grateful to the entire unit. JAI HIND ! ",
